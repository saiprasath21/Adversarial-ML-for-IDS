# Adversarial-ML-for-IDS

## Summary
- Extensive analysis and understanding of the New Gas Pipeline Dataset
- Attacking rule based models using explainable AI techniques
- ZOO based coordinated descent algorithm for handling binary and continuous features (+ one hot encoder + constraints + attack property preservation)
- Analyse defense mechanisms (Model based and data based)


## Files and Dir
- **data:** Contains the raw dataset and the processed data used for training the deep learning models
- **src:** Contains the source code for pre-processing the data and performing exploratory data analysis
- **results:** Contains the results of the hyper parameter search and model comparison
- **ICS_IDS:** Performs various adversarial attacks (Iterative FGSM and ZOO) and also evalutes the effectiveness of different defense strategies.
